# Temperature Analog Sensor Module

#### Project Overview

The Temperature Analog Sensor Module project showcases how to measure temperature using an analog temperature sensor with an Arduino Nano. Analog temperature sensors provide a voltage output proportional to the temperature they detect. This project utilizes the Arduino Nano's analog input capabilities to read the sensor's output voltage and convert it into temperature readings.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Analog Temperature Sensor Module (e.g., LM35)**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Temperature Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the temperature sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure the sensor's power (VCC) and ground (GND) pins are connected to the appropriate pins on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the temperature sensor module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display the temperature readings in Celsius.
   - Observe the temperature readings and verify their accuracy based on the ambient temperature.

#### Applications

- **Environmental Monitoring:** Measure temperature in various environments for monitoring and control applications.
- **Climate Control Systems:** Use temperature sensors in HVAC systems for regulating heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.
- **Industrial Automation:** Monitor temperature in industrial processes for safety and quality control purposes.

#### Notes

- Calibration: Ensure the temperature sensor is calibrated correctly for accurate temperature readings.
- Sensor Selection: Choose a temperature sensor suitable for the application's temperature range and accuracy requirements.
- Sampling Rate: Adjust the delay between sensor readings to achieve the desired sampling rate while considering power consumption and responsiveness.
